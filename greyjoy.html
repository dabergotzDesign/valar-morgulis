                <p class="character">King Euron Greyjoy was the brother of Balon Greyjoy, the Lord Reaper of Pyke and later King of the Iron Islands, and Aeron Greyjoy, a Drowned Man.
                  He was also uncle to Balon's children, Rodrik, Maron, Yara, and Theon Greyjoy. After murdering Balon, Euron takes control of the Salt Throne with the support of many ironborn,
                  seeking to hunt down Yara and Theon, who oppose Euron and ally with Daenerys Targaryen.
                  Euron is named commander of the Lannister fleet - although he primarily uses the Iron Fleet as his main ships - after he defeats the ironborn and
                  Dornish allies of Daenerys in Blackwater Bay, delivering Ellaria and Tyene Sand as a gift to Cersei Lannister, whom he intended to marry following the end of the war.
                  Euron continues to remain an ally of Cersei, ferrying the Golden Company to Westeros, killing Rhaegal, and fighting at the Battle of King's Landing, where his fleet is burnt by Drogon.
                  Euron himself was subsequently killed in a duel by Cersei's brother and lover, Ser Jaime Lannister.                    
                  Euron was captain of the longship Silence, the flagship of the Iron Fleet, and wielded a two-handed battleaxe in combat.
                  His personal sigil was the standard House Greyjoy heraldry of a kraken on black, but the kraken has a third red eye inscribed onto its head and is sometimes silver instead of gold.</p>

                <p class="character">Prince Theon Greyjoy was the youngest son of King Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands and the younger brother of Rodrik, Maron, and Yara Greyjoy.
                    Following his father's failed rebellion against the Iron Throne, Theon is taken as a ward (initially hostage) to Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.
                    After Eddard's execution in King's Landing, Theon pledges his loyalty to Eddard's eldest son, King Robb Stark, in the subsequent War of the Five Kings,
                    but ultimately betrays Robb and sides with his father in invading the North. Theon takes Winterfell from Robb's brother, Bran, but eventually is betrayed by his own men,
                    which leads to his capture by House Bolton. He is tortured and forced into servitude by Ramsay Snow, who turns him into a broken pet named Reek.
                    Theon, however, redeems himself by helping Ramsay's wife (and Robb's sister), Sansa Stark, escape from Winterfell and find refuge with her "half-brother" Jon Snow. The two later retake Winterfell,
                    defeating Ramsay and House Bolton.                    
                    Slowly returning to his former self, Theon returns to the Iron Islands, where he learns of his father's death at the hands of his uncle, Euron Greyjoy, who is later elected King of the Iron Islands via Kingsmoot.
                    In retaliation, Theon flees with Yara to seek out an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen, where they pledge their forces to her.
                    Despite abandoning Yara during the assault on the Targaryen Fleet, he later appeals to the remaining ironborn on Dragonstone to rescue her from Euron's custody, a mission they complete successfully.
                    While Yara sails to retake the Iron Islands, Theon returns to Winterfell with a group of ironborn to fight for House Stark in the Great War.
                    Theon perishes defending Bran from the Night King during the Battle of Winterfell, redeeming himself at last.</p>

                  and older sister and only surviving sibling of Theon Greyjoy. She was raised at Pyke, the stronghold of House Greyjoy.
                  Yara is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship, the Black Wind.
                  After the assassination of her father, Yara lays claim to the Iron Islands, but when the ironborn choose her uncle Euron,
                  who murdered Balon, as their next king, she and Theon flee with a portion of the Iron Fleet and their loyal followers.
                  Yara and Theon become allies with Daenerys Targaryen. Yara is then captured by her uncle when he attacks the Targaryen fleet,
                  though she is later freed by Theon and their remaining loyalists. Intent on claiming the Salt Throne,
                  Yara sails what remains of her army to successfully retake the Iron Islands. After the assassination of Daenerys,
                  Yara participates in the Great Council of 305 AC and consents to the choosing of Bran Stark as the new King of the Andals and the First Men.</p>
