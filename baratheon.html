                    Following the deposition of House Targaryen, and subsequent ascension of his eldest brother, Robert,
                    he was granted the title of Lord Paramount of the Stormlands, despite his youth.
                    He also served as Master of Laws on Robert's Small council, but abandoned the latter position when laying claim to the Iron Throne upon Robert's death,
                    styling himself as Renly of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men,
                    Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.                    
                    Following the revelation that his brother's supposed progeny were products of incest, Renly's elder brother, Stannis,
                    also laid claim to the Iron Throne.                    
                    Margaery Tyrell became Renly's queen in an alliance with her house; however, it was her brother Loras whom he truly loved.
                    During talks of an alliance with the Starks, his campaign abruptly ended when a Shadow killed Renly,
                    as orchestrated by Stannis and his lover, Melisandre. This led most of his bannermen from the Stormlands,
                    and some of the Reach, to submit to Stannis as their new king. He was ultimately avenged by his loyal Kingsguard, Brienne of Tarth,

                  and the Lord of Storm's End. After escaping the massacre of Robert's other bastards in King's Landing,
                  Gendry is slated to join the Night's Watch before being captured and traded multiple times - first to Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal,
                  then to the Brotherhood Without Banners, and finally to Stannis Baratheon on Dragonstone.
                  After escaping from Dragonstone with the help of Ser Davos Seaworth, Gendry returns to King's Landing and remains in hiding until Davos returns for him.
                  He later accompanies Jon Snow north of the Wall on a mission to capture a wight to use as a bargaining chip at the Dragonpit Summit,
                  before joining the ranks of Queen Daenerys Targaryen's army at Winterfell.
                  With the death of King Robert, the massacre of his other bastards, the deaths of Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis,
                  as well as Stannis's daughter Shireen, Gendry is the last known living person of the Baratheon bloodline.
                  As such, Daenerys legitimizes Gendry following the Battle of Winterfell, making him the head of the revived House Baratheon.
                  As one of the great lords of the Seven Kingdoms, Gendry participates in the Great Council of 305 AC to decide the new ruler of Westeros following the assassination of Daenerys.
                  He agrees to the ascension of Bran Stark, as an elective monarch.</p>

                    Following Robert's death and the revelation that Robert's heir, Joffrey, is actually Queen Cersei's bastard son with her twin brother Jaime,
                    Stannis declares himself the rightful King and begins a campaign to take the Iron Throne from the Lannisters,

                    Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. After amassing an army, Stannis attacks King's Landing and almost breaches the city's gates,
                    but is defeated by combined Lannister-Tyrell reinforcements and forced to retreat to Dragonstone.
                    While planning his next move following the deaths of Joffrey and Robb Stark, Stannis travels north to the Wall to aid the Night's Watch against a wildling invasion and
                    meets Jon Snow, attempting to acquire his help in retaking the North from House Bolton, who previously betrayed House Stark and murdered Robb.
                    Stannis ultimately marches on Winterfell alone, but the weather slows his progress and he and his army are smashed by Bolton forces in the ensuing battle.
                    In the aftermath, he is found, injured and exhausted from the battle and ultimately killed by Brienne of Tarth for his role in Renly's death.</p>

                  Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister,
                  Joffrey is actually a bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard.
                  His bastardy, however, would unofficially make him the first ruling king without any blood relation to House Targaryen,
                  as he had no blood relationship to his legal father, King Robert, whose ancestor and the founder of House Baratheon, Orys Baratheon,
                  was the bastard brother of King Aegon I Targaryen, commonly known as Aegon the conqueror. He is the older brother of Myrcella and Tommen Baratheon,
                  both of whom share the same parentage. Joffrey's actions during his rule sparked the War of the Five Kings and ended when he was poisoned at his own wedding feast by Olenna Tyrell and

Though legally the son of the late King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, his true father is Ser Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother, and is thus a bastard born of incest. His sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.

                    After his brother's death during his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Tommen assumed the throne under the name of Tommen of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, making him the nineteenth ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Many thought his reign would be a vast improvement as, unlike his brother, who was sadistic and mean-spirited, Tommen was good natured and kind towards his peers.
                    
                    Although originally a mere pawn in the rivalry between his mother and his new wife, Tommen found purpose with the rise of the religious Sparrows. Under the influence of their leader, he attempted to bring about a new age of joint rule between the Crown and the Faith.
                    
                    After witnessing the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, learning of the death of his beloved Queen among all the casualties and seeing his faith in ruins, Tommen committed suicide by self-defenestration in the Red Keep.
                    
                    He was also the Last person to serve as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms since the North would gain independence, changing the title to Lord of the Six Kingdoms.</p>
