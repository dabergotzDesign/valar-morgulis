                    the heir to the Iron Throne, Sansa travels to King's Landing in preparation for her nuptials,
                    but essentially becomes a hostage of House Lannister following the execution of her father on trumped-up charges of treason.
                    Under the (sometimes unwitting) tutelage of Cersei Lannister, Margaery Tyrell, and Petyr Baelish,
                    Sansa becomes well versed in politics and court intrigue, but suffers all the same.
                    Even after escaping the capital and returning to her childhood home of Winterfell,
                    she endures further hardship at the hands of House Bolton.
                    After escaping from Winterfell with the help of her father's former ward, Theon Greyjoy, and her sworn-sword,
                    Brienne of Tarth, Sansa reunites with Jon at Castle Black. Along with the support of the Free Folk, the knights of the Vale,
                    and certain Northern houses, the two of them retake Winterfell from Ramsay Bolton, and Sansa becomes the Lady of Winterfell,
                    whilst Jon is declared King in the North.                      
                    Displeased at Jon for abdicating his title in favor of House Targaryen, she finds enmity with Queen Daenerys,
                    who refuses to accept Northern independence in her restoration and quest for the Iron Throne.
                    Following the Battle of King's Landing and Daenerys's subsequent assassination,
                    Sansa declares the North an independent kingdom and is later crowned Queen in the North.</p>

                    After narrowly escaping the persecution of House Stark by House Lannister, Arya is trained as a Faceless Man at the House of Black and White in Braavos,
                    using her abilities to avenge her family.
                    Upon her return to Westeros, she exacts retribution for the Red Wedding by exterminating the Frey male line.
                    Returning to Winterfell, Arya initially finds herself at odds with Sansa due to the naïvety of her youth and perceived lack of support for their "half-brother",
                    Jon Snow, King in the North. However, their tumultuous relationship is discovered to be the result of Petyr Baelish's manipulation,
                    and the two mend their sisterhood following his execution for his crimes against House Stark.
                    Arya then plays a significant role in the Great War, effectively ending the conflict through her killing of the Night King during the Battle of Winterfell.
                    Afterwards, Arya rides south with the Hound to kill Cersei Lannister, not intent on returning to Winterfell.
                    She arrives at King's Landing as it is being destroyed by Daenerys Targaryen. After Sandor convinces Arya to abandon her quest for vengeance;
                    Arya tries in vain to help the smallfolk survive the destruction of the city.
                    Weeks later, following Daenerys's assassination, Arya attends the great council that decides the future of Westeros.
                    Arya's younger brother Bran is chosen as king by all the lords and ladies present there and the North is granted its independence.
                    After bidding farewell to her siblings, Arya decides to leave Westeros and sail west to discover what lies beyond where the maps of the known world end.</p>
